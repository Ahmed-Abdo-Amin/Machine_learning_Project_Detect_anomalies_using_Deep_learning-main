because of the huge time while training the models , 
we had to divide the project into four parts : 
termProject_part1 , termProject_part2, termProject_Bonus_part1 , termProject_Bonus_part2 
to run the code first run termProject_part1, then termProject_part2 , then termProject_Bonus_part1 finnaly run  termProject_Bonus_part2. 

while performing the dimensionality techniques we used 50 epochs also because of the training time

thanks
